Fighter


Map:

Alt A;
    We could use a list of basic map textures, building the map by basic small squares.
    This would enable the creation of new maps on the go.

Alt B;
    We create the map elements as different objects, adding them togheter as we see fit in the map.

Alt C;
    Using an image as the map, we just create the collosion parameters,

Alt D;
    Suggestions??



Characters:

Using basic figures like circle, square, triangle.
Creating each character using a single type of figure.

	 Character A;
	 	   Torso-triangle, legs-triangle, head-triangle.
	 Character B;
	 	   Torso-circle, legs-circle, head-circle.

Using this system we build the characters like Rayman (no joints).
This system should enable us to simplify animations.




Fighting system:

Using some basic punch, kick + jump, crouch.
Each characthers special move.
Different hitpoints depending on where u hit the person
